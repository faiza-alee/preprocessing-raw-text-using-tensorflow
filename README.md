Preprocessing Raw Text Using TensorFlow
In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to preprocess raw text data for natural language processing using TensorFlow. Weâ€™ll work with the following sentences:

"I love my dog"
"I, love my cat"
"You love my dog!"
Key Steps in Preprocessing:
Normalization: Convert all text to lowercase and remove punctuation to standardize the input.
Tokenization: Split each sentence into individual words (tokens).
Optional Stop Word Removal: Common words (e.g., "I," "my") can be removed to focus on meaningful terms.
Vectorization: Transform the tokens into numerical representations for model input.
This preprocessing helps in preparing the text data for various machine learning models, making it suitable for tasks such as classification, sentiment analysis, and more.

By following the example code, you can efficiently preprocess text data using TensorFlow, setting a strong foundation for your NLP projects.
